# iocoop-stage
## Overview of the iocoop-stage GitHub organization

This GitHub organization was created to test [birch-girder](https://github.com/gene1wood/birch-girder) within a GitHub organization (instead of just a GitHub user). It works but we discovered that free GitHub organizations can't have private wikis which is a bit of a show stopper for moving from a model where we share the [`iocoop` GitHub user](https://github.com/iocoop/) to a model where `iocoop` becomes a GitHub organization (like [`iocoop-stage`](https://github.com/iocoop-stage/iocoop-stage/).

We talked about potentially migrating the IO Coop wiki off of GitHub (and onto a private jekyll instance or something) but ended up figuring that it was too much work for the moment for anyone to sign on for. As a result we've stuck with using birch-girder on repos owned by the `iocoop` GitHub user.
